Error-418's website, thing for technical writing, and coding projects

First, sort of, full commit. New content to generate. Working on a few projects in the background will update as I have progress.

It's mostly small tool projects for now. Also learning Jekyll, hopefully this is all working as intended when I wake up in the morning.
